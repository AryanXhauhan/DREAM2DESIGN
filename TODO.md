# Debug Code Generation Issue

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Check .env file for OPENROUTER_API_KEY
- [x] Verify server is running or start it
- [x] Test code generation and check logs
- [x] Inspect and fix any errors (API, parsing, file saving)
- [x] Ensure jobs/ directory is writable
- [x] Add fallback to DeepSeek model when Qwen3 Coder fails
- [x] Test job creation with fallback model

## Findings
- API key was invalid initially (401 "User not found")
- Updated with valid OpenRouter API key
- Qwen3 Coder model returns 429 (rate limited)
- Added DeepSeek Chat as fallback model
- Job creation now works successfully with proper file generation
- Generated files are complete and functional
