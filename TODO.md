# Debug Code Generation Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Check .env file for OPENROUTER_API_KEY
- [x] Verify server is running or start it
- [x] Test code generation and check logs
- [x] Inspect and fix any errors (API, parsing, file saving)
- [x] Ensure jobs/ directory is writable
- [x] Add fallback to DeepSeek model when Qwen3 Coder fails
- [x] Test job creation with fallback model

## Findings & Resolution
- ✅ API key was invalid initially (401 "User not found")
- ✅ Updated .env with valid OpenRouter API key
- ✅ Server starts successfully with API key loaded
- ✅ Qwen3 Coder model returns 429 (rate limited) - added DeepSeek Chat fallback
- ✅ Job creation now works successfully with proper file generation
- ✅ Generated files are complete and functional (HTML, CSS, JS)
- ✅ Multiple successful jobs created and completed

## Current Status
- Job creation is fully functional
- AI code generation working with dual model support (Qwen3 Coder + DeepSeek fallback)
- Files are successfully generated and saved to jobs/ directory
- Preview HTML and frontend files (index.html, styles.css, app.js) are created
